This repository takes the code from the May submission as base. Thereafter, I am working on cleaning up this code, correcting errors and refining it for its purpose. This constitutes the main branch.

The May submission branch contains the final code used in the May submission of our paper. It is used as the basis for the repository where we refine this after the May submission. It should not be pushed back into the main branch.
