This repository takes the code from the May submission as base. Thereafter, I am working on cleaning up this code, correcting errors and refining it for its purpose. This constitutes the main branch.

The May submission branch contains the final code used in the May submission of our paper. It is used as the basis for the repository where we refine this after the May submission. It should not be pushed back into the main branch.

This branch 'Checking regression covariance function' has code which I wrote during the refining and synchronizing process to check the regression covariance functions between the graphing and cross validation code.
